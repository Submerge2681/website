Fridays For Future (FFF) India was started by Indian youth activists from across the country in March 2019. We are a grassroots, youth powered people's movement united for equitable climate and environmental justice. We use art, music, education, policy intervention, on ground campaigns, digital campaigns and local governance to change conversations about the climate crisis while also urging governments in India and across the world to act on the crisis.
<br> 
<br> 
We strongly believe that the climate crisis can only be addressed by passion, compassionate honesty and community care. The climate crisis is deeply political but our movement is independent of commercial interests and political affiliations and knows no borders.
<br>

We currently have numerous local chapters in different cities across India. We welcome everyone to join us. Everyone is welcome. Everyone is valued.
